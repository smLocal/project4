## About

I'm going to be updating a repair shop site that needs help ASAP.
They want customers to be able to send in their info and ask for
an appointment. I also would like to make a blog, as a stretch goal.
There will be content, and maybe even a page that shows work that was
done if you click on what type of repairs you are interested in.

## Technologies 

I will use nodemailer, node, express, and maybe angular. I would like
to add a gulpfile. I plan on adding materialize on Thursday morning and 
then fixing issues Thursday afternoon.
