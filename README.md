## About

I'm going to be updating a repair shop site that needs help ASAP.
They want customers to be able to send in their info and ask for
an appointment. I also would like to make a blog, as a stretch goal.
There will be content, and maybe even a page that shows work that was
done if you click on what type of repairs you are interested in.

## Technologies 

I will use nodemailer, node, express, and angular. I would like
to add a gulpfile later. Also used Materialize and favicon, bcrypt, 
nodemailer and ui-router.

## Installation
* Fork over the repo
* Cd to project 4
* Npm install
* Or just visit the above heroku link

## Unsolved Problems
A big hurdle was starting off men stack and then going mean stack.
I wouldn't recommend it to my enemy.
* Login
* Content
* Blog
* Functionality
* Materialize
* Etc.
